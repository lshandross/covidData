\title{Assemble a data frame of incident hospitalizations due to
COVID-19 or influenza as they were available as of a specified issue date.}
\usage{
load_healthdata_data(
  issue_date = NULL,
  as_of = NULL,
  location_code = NULL,
  spatial_resolution = "state",
  temporal_resolution = "weekly",
  measure = c("hospitalizations", "flu hospitalizations"),
  replace_negatives = FALSE,
  adjustment_cases = "none",
  adjustment_method = "none",
  geography = "US",
  drop_last_date = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{issue_date}{character issue date (i.e. report date) to use for
constructing truths in format 'yyyy-mm-dd'}

\item{location_code}{character vector of location codes. Default to NULL
This should be a list of state FIPS code and/or 'US'.}

\item{spatial_resolution}{character vector specifying spatial unit types to
include: state' and/or 'national'
This parameter will be ignored if location_code is provided.}

\item{temporal_resolution}{character vector specifying temporal resolution
to include: 'daily' or 'weekly'}

\item{measure}{character vector specifying measure of disease prevalence:
either 'hospitalizations' for COVID hospitalizations or
'flu hospitalizations' for hospitalizations with influenza}

\item{replace_negatives}{boolean to replace negative incs with imputed data
Currently only FALSE is supported}

\item{adjustment_cases}{character vector specifying times and locations with
reporting anomalies to adjust.  Only the value "none" is currently supported}

\item{adjustment_method}{string specifying how anomalies are adjusted.
Only the value "none" is currently supported.}

\item{geography}{character, which data to read. Only "US" is supported.}

\item{drop_last_date}{boolean indicating whether to drop the last 1 day of
data for the influenza and COVID hospitalization signals. The last day of
data from the HHS data source is unreliable, so it is recommended to set this
to \code{TRUE}. However, the default is \code{FALSE} so that the function maintains
fidelity to the authoritative data source.}
}
\value{
data frame with columns location (fips code), date, inc, and cum
all values of cum will currently be NA
